Manhunt is a Minecraft Bedrock game mode function suitsble for 2-10 players. At the start of the game, a speedrunner is chosen to speedrun Minecraft, while others will become hunters and attempt to kill the runner.
## Roles
### Runner
Runners have to complete Minecraft (kill the ender dragon and return to overworld) while trying to avoid getting killed by hunters. The run is seperated into 15 parts, and in each part the runner will have to complete the mission given to advance to the next part. Once the runner dies, they will not be able to respawn and hunters win the game.  
In competitive mode, the runner will only start with an iron chestplate. In casual however, the runner will receive a full leather armor with enchanted tools.
