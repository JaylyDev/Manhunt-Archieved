# manhunt
**Try to beat Minecraft in the shortest time possible, or stop the speedrun.**  
Manhunt is a Minecraft Bedrock game mode function suitsble for 2-10 players. At the start of the game, a speedrunner is chosen to speedrun Minecraft, while others will become hunters and attempt to kill the runner.
## Roles
The roles of the two teams in the game.
### Runner
Runners have to complete Minecraft (kill the ender dragon and return to overworld) while trying to avoid getting killed by hunters. The run is seperated into 15 parts, and in each part the runner will have to complete the mission given to advance to the next part. Once the runner dies, they will not be able to respawn and hunters win the game.  
In competitive mode, the runner will only start with an iron chestplate. In casual however, the runner will receive a full leather armor with enchanted tools.
### Hunter
Hunters attempt to kill the runner before they complete the game or before the timer ends. In competitive mode, they respawn immediately at their original spawn point, where in casual, they spawn after 6 seconds near the runner. In competitive, hunters will not have any items when they spawn/respawn, but in casual, they have a sword on spawn. Hunters are also given a compass that can be used to track the runners position.
